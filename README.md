I've created this library for my job and thought will share as maybe somebody else would find it useful.

Currently it can do following for given docx file:
* Enable tracked changes.
* Anonymize comments.
* Deanonymize comments.

See tests to get familiar with the usage.

Don't know if I'll add more functionality in the future, it may be left as-is forever. As always you're using it at your own risk. Enjoy.
